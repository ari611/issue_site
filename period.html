				Menstruation etiquette supported <span id="highlight">concealment and secrecy.</span> Companies like Playtex and Tampax promoted parameters of acceptable behavior to teach young girls that menstruating should be <span id="highlight">“invisible”</span> and protected from the sight of men and the public. Menstruation management advertisements suggested that young women should conceal their periods physically and socially, to prevent embarrassment or shame. 

			</p>

			<p>
				Menstrual products (for example, tampons, pads) are designed to absorb fluid and odors, not to be visible through one’s clothes, to be small enough to carry <span id="highlight">unobtrusively in one’s purse</span>, and to be discretely discarded in a lined bin in a public restroom
			</p>

			<p>
				Due to the conversation around menstruation being suppressed, beliefs about people on their periods being unclean are widespread. This often leads to women and girls feeling confined to their homes, being excluded from public spaces, or considered to be bad luck or harmful to others for about a week every month.
