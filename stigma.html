	<h4>Period Stigma</h4>
	<div class="stigmaPara">

		<p>
			Menstruation is a healthy and natural part of the reproductive cycle, yet many children and adolescents in the region experience both period stigma and period poverty (not having access to safe, hygienic, menstrual products) during their life. Misinformation and lack of basic knowledge lead to girls being out of school during their period or makes children and adolescents <span id="highlight">feel ashamed for bleeding</span>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Every child should know what a period is and how the cycle works in order to feel normal and secure in their own body. The possibility to keep good menstrual health and hygiene is a core part of <span id="highlight">dignity and prosperity</span> for children in MENA and is manifested in several human rights, such as the right to live in dignity, the right to health and the right to bodily autonomy. In MENA, mensuration may directly impact childrenâ€™s education as menstruating children may be reluctant to go to school because of stigma and inadequate sanitary facilities. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Learning about menstruation and creating <span id="highlight">safe spaces</span> to have conversations and exchange knowledge is a crucial aspect to empower, build self-esteem and end period stigma. Conversations about menstruation should be done <span id="highlight">openly</span> at schools, in the private life, including with the support and engagement of male family members, as well as in the community at large.
